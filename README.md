Welcome to my Competitive Coding world. 
<br>
I started competitive programming in May 2020 and solved over 750 problems on various online judges. Unfortunately, I had to leave competitive programming in March 2023 because most of the NCPC and ICPC contests were scheduled during my exams. This was a particularly disappointing time for me, as I wanted to participate but couldn't perform due to my academic commitments. Here are my achievements:

    Champion, ICE Fiesta Programming Contest 2023
    Bangladesh 3rd Rank (Global 350th), Codeforces Round 857 (Div. 2)
    Bangladesh 5th Rank (Global 123rd), CodeChef Starters 79 (Div. 2)
    Bangladesh 4th Rank (Global 171st), CodeChef Starters 49 (Div. 4)
Here is some of my profiles:
